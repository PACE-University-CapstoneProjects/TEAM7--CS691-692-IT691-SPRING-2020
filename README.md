Using AI Enabled Robotic Fish to Combat Environmental Waste

Team Members: Matthew Crespo, Matt Brown, Vineetha Alluri,Robert Consigliere, Janaya Cooper.

Customer: Matthew R. Ganis.

The combination of Robotic Fish and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is becoming one of the most prominent research
discoveries of our time. The advanced technology, software
engineering, big data and extensive trials has led to their success.
Many robotic fish research are being found all over the web. Each
helps cater to our environmental, cyber warfare, and machine
learning needs. However, Robotic Fish are not to be linked to
underwater drones, but are linked to reducing of global warming,
greenhouse gases, and the extinction of other underwater life.
Robotic Fish and Artificial intelligence provide a special outlook
on intellectual implementation results for educational resources.
